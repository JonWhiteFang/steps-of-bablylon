- Changes made:
  - Updated `docs/StepsOfBabylon_GDD.md` — replaced all Google Fit references with Health Connect (§2.1, §11.1–§11.4, §15.1, §17, §19). Fixed anti-cheat rate limit from ">500 steps/min" to "200/min (250 burst)".
  - Updated `docs/database-schema.md` — DailyStepRecord: `googleFitSteps` → `healthConnectSteps`, added `escrowSteps` and `escrowSyncCount` columns.
  - Updated `docs/architecture.md` — layer diagram "Google Fit" → "Health Connect", DI section now lists actual modules (StepModule, HealthConnectModule) instead of "Future modules".
  - Rewrote `docs/plans/plan-05-google-fit.md` — body now reflects actual Health Connect implementation with correct file paths and class names.
  - Updated `docs/plans/plan-25-anti-cheat.md` — all Google Fit references → Health Connect, corrected package paths (`data/healthconnect/` not `data/googlefit/`).
  - Updated `docs/plans/plan-30-release.md` — ProGuard keep rules, privacy policy, and checklist updated for Health Connect.
  - Updated `docs/plans/master-plan.md` — Plan 10 description corrected (orbs/bounce were deferred to 10b).

- Remaining cosmetic issues (not fixed — completed plans, code is correct):
  - `docs/plans/plan-02-database.md` and `plan-03-repositories.md` still reference `googleFitSteps` column name (these are historical plan docs; actual code uses `healthConnectSteps`)
  - `docs/agent/RUN_LOG.md` references are historical records (correct to leave as-is)
  - `docs/agent/DECISIONS/ADR-0002-health-connect.md` references are contextual (explaining the decision)
  - `docs/agent/state.json` is an orphaned file from earlier approach (harmless)
  - `docs/temp/` contains a reference playbook from setup (harmless)
- Commands/tests run: N/A (documentation-only changes)
- Memory updated: STATE ✅ / RUN_LOG ✅

## 2026-03-06 — Plan 12: Round Lifecycle & Post-Round
- Goal: Full round lifecycle with post-round summary, best wave persistence, pause overlay, auto-pause.
- Decisions made:
  - (b) Post-round as overlay within Battle route (avoids ViewModel re-creation)
  - (a) Engine owns totalEnemiesKilled + elapsedTimeSeconds (single source of truth)
  - (a) Quit Round shows summary and saves best wave (player earned that progress)
- Changes made:
  - Updated `presentation/battle/engine/GameEngine.kt` — added totalEnemiesKilled, elapsedTimeSeconds, totalCashEarned tracking; made roundOver publicly settable for quit flow
  - Created `domain/usecase/UpdateBestWave.kt` — compares wave to stored best, persists if new record, returns Result(isNewRecord, previousBest)
  - Updated `presentation/battle/BattleUiState.kt` — added RoundEndState data class and roundEndState field

## 2026-03-06 — Plan 13: Tier System & Progression
- Goal: Tier unlock logic, tier selector UI, battle conditions at Tier 6+, post-round tier unlock notification.
- Decisions made:
  - (a) Armor as hit counter — enemies block first N hits, then take full damage. Punishes fast-attack/low-damage builds.
  - (a) Minimal tier selector — horizontal chip row on home screen, not a dedicated screen.
  - (b) Notify only on unlock — player stays on current tier, chooses when to advance via selector.
  - Added `highestUnlockedTier` as separate field from `currentTier` (play tier) to support tier selection.
  - DB version bumped to 2 with destructive fallback (dev phase — proper migration before release).
- Changes made:

  - (a) Derive biome unlock from highestUnlockedTier — no DB change, first-seen via SharedPreferences.
  - Enemy tinting via 30% color blend with base type color (not color filter).
  - Ziggurat colors passed as constructor parameter, paints built dynamically.
- Changes made:
  - Created `presentation/battle/biome/BiomeTheme.kt` — 5 biome palettes (sky, ground, ziggurat, enemy tint, particles)

  - (a) Stub SURGE — shows in UI, deducts cost, but UW cooldown reset is no-op until Plan 15.
  - (a) Skip free charges — deferred to Plan 19 (Walking Encounters).
  - (a) Engine-side aura — pulsing circle + timer bar rendered on Canvas, respects game speed.
- Changes made:
  - Created `domain/usecase/ActivateOverdrive.kt` — sealed Result, checks balance + once-per-round
  - Created `presentation/battle/ui/OverdriveMenu.kt` — 4-option selection with cost/affordability

## 2026-03-06 — Plan 16: Labs System
- Goal: Implement Labs research system — 10 time-gated research projects, lab slots, Gem rush, auto-completion.
- Decisions made:
  - (a) Cost scaling 1.15, time scaling 1.10 — moderate ramp matching Workshop feel.
  - (a) Gem rush: linear interpolation `50 + fraction × 150` (range 50–200 Gems).
  - (a) Per-type scaling fields on ResearchType enum (tunable in Plan 28).
- Changes made:
  - Updated `domain/model/ResearchType.kt` — added `costScaling: Double = 1.15` and `timeScaling: Double = 1.10`
  - Created `domain/usecase/CalculateResearchCost.kt` — `baseCostSteps × costScaling^level`
  - Created `domain/usecase/CalculateResearchTime.kt` — `baseTimeHours × timeScaling^level`

## 2026-03-06 — Plan 17: Cards System
- Goal: Implement Cards system — 9 card types, 3 rarities, pack opening, Card Dust upgrades, loadout, battle integration.
- Decisions made:
  - (a) Pack distributions: Common 80/18/2, Rare 50/40/10, Epic 20/40/40. Dust from dupes: 5/15/50.
  - (a) Numeric fields on CardType enum with linear interpolation for level scaling.
  - (b) Post-process pattern: ApplyCardEffects modifies ResolvedStats copy, ResolveStats untouched.
- Changes made:
  - Updated `domain/model/CardType.kt` — added valueLv1/valueLv5/secondaryLv1/secondaryLv5, effectAtLevel(), secondaryAtLevel()
  - Updated `domain/model/CardRarity.kt` — added dustValue (5/15/50) and upgradeDustPerLevel (10/25/50)

  - Created 4 test classes (22 new tests):
    - OpenCardPackTest (4), UpgradeCardTest (4), ApplyCardEffectsTest (11), ManageCardLoadoutTest (3)
- Commands/tests run: `./run-gradle.sh testDebugUnitTest` — 155 tests, 0 failures. `./run-gradle.sh assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- Open questions / blockers: Step Surge gemMultiplier tracked but not consumed (no Gem earning in battle — deferred to Plan 20).
- Memory updated: STATE ✅ / RUN_LOG ✅

## Run — 2026-03-06 — Plan 19: Walking Encounters & Supply Drops

### Objective
Implement Plan 19: Supply drop generation during walks, push notifications, claim system, and inbox UI.

### What was done
1. **Task 1 — Enums & type safety**: Created `SupplyDropTrigger` (4 entries with notification messages) and `SupplyDropReward` (4 entries). Updated `SupplyDrop` domain model from raw `String` fields to type-safe enums. Updated `WalkingEncounterRepository` interface and `WalkingEncounterRepositoryImpl` to use enums (stored as `.name` strings in Room).

2. **Task 2 — GenerateSupplyDrop use case**: Seeded random drop generation with 3 active triggers (milestone at 10k, threshold at 2k boundaries with 5% per 100 steps, random at 1% per 500 steps). Step burst deferred. Created `DropGeneratorState` for tracking. 9 unit tests, all green.

3. **Task 3 — ClaimSupplyDrop use case**: Credits reward to correct `PlayerRepository` method based on `SupplyDropReward` type, marks drop claimed. Created `FakeWalkingEncounterRepository`. 6 unit tests, all green.

4. **Task 4 — Inbox cap enforcement**: Added `deleteOldestUnclaimed()` and `countUnclaimedOnce()` to `WalkingEncounterDao`. Added `enforceInboxCap(maxSize)` and `getUnclaimedCount()` to repository interface/impl.

5. **Task 5 — SupplyDropNotificationManager**: Dedicated `supply_drops` notification channel (IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT), unique notification IDs per drop, deep-link intent to supplies screen.

6. **Task 6 — DailyStepManager integration**: Added `WalkingEncounterRepository` and `SupplyDropNotificationManager` as dependencies. After step crediting, calls `GenerateSupplyDrop`, enforces inbox cap, creates drop, and sends notification. Tracks `DropGeneratorState` with day rollover reset.

7. **Task 7 — UnclaimedSuppliesScreen**: Added `Screen.Supplies` route. Created `UnclaimedSuppliesViewModel` (observes unclaimed drops, claim/claimAll), `SuppliesUiState`, and `UnclaimedSuppliesScreen` (LazyColumn with claim buttons, empty state, relative timestamps). Added route to `NavHost` in `MainActivity` with notification deep-link handling.

8. **Task 8 — Home screen inbox badge**: Added `unclaimedDropCount` to `HomeUiState`. Injected `WalkingEncounterRepository` into `HomeViewModel`, added to `combine()`. Added `BadgedBox` button on `HomeScreen` that shows when count > 0, navigates to supplies. Added `onSuppliesClick` callback wired in `MainActivity`.

### Decisions
- No GPS triggers — step-based only, defer to future plan.
- No free Overdrive charges — burst trigger deferred, avoids Room migration.
- Inbox overflow discards oldest unclaimed drop silently.
- No Card Pack reward — Card Dust instead, avoids coupling to OpenCardPack flow.
- 10k milestone gives 5 Gems (single drop); Power Stones deferred to combined reward enhancement.
- No notification action button — tap opens inbox screen (avoids BroadcastReceiver complexity).

### Test results
- 170 total JVM tests (155 existing + 15 new), all green, 0 failures.
- New: GenerateSupplyDropTest (9), ClaimSupplyDropTest (6).

### What remains
- Step burst trigger (needs step velocity tracking in DailyStepManager).
- 10k milestone second reward (Power Stones) — could be two drops or combined.
- Custom notification icons (currently using system placeholders).
- Supply drop notification preferences (on/off toggle — Plan 23).
- Claim animation in UnclaimedSuppliesScreen (polish — Plan 27).

## Run — 2026-03-06 — Plan 20: Power Stone & Gem Economy

### Objective
Implement premium currency earning systems: weekly step challenges, daily login rewards, and wave milestone bonuses.

### What was done
1. **Task 1 — Database**: Created `WeeklyChallengeEntity` + `WeeklyChallengeDao`, `DailyLoginEntity` + `DailyLoginDao`. Added `currentStreak`/`lastLoginDate` to `PlayerProfileEntity`/`PlayerProfile`. Added `updateStreak()` to `PlayerProfileDao`/`PlayerRepository`. Added `sumCreditedSteps()` to `DailyStepDao`. Bumped DB to version 4 (9 entities). Updated `DatabaseModule` with 2 new DAO providers. Updated `FakePlayerRepository` with streak support.

2. **Task 2 — Weekly Step Challenge**: Created `TrackWeeklyChallenge` use case. Queries weekly step sum from `DailyStepDao`, awards PS at 50k (10), 75k (20 total), 100k (35 total) thresholds. Only awards delta PS for newly crossed tiers.

3. **Task 3 — Daily Login & Streak**: Created `TrackDailyLogin` use case. Awards 1 PS when 1k+ steps walked (once/day). Manages 7-day Gem streak: consecutive days increment streak, missed day resets to 1, awards min(streak, 5) Gems. Streak cycles after day 7.

4. **Task 4 — Wave Milestone PS**: Created `AwardWaveMilestone` use case. Awards 1 PS (base), 2 PS (wave % 10 == 0), or 5 PS (wave % 25 == 0) on new personal bests. Integrated into `BattleViewModel.endRound()`. Added `powerStonesAwarded` to `RoundEndState`. Updated `PostRoundOverlay` to display PS earned.

5. **Task 5 — Currency Dashboard**: Created `Screen.Economy` route. Created `CurrencyDashboardViewModel` + `CurrencyDashboardScreen` with weekly progress bar, 3 threshold markers, login streak dots (7-day), daily PS status, and currency balances.

6. **Task 6 — Integration**: Updated `DailyStepManager` with `DailyLoginDao`, `WeeklyChallengeDao`, `DailyStepDao` dependencies. Calls `TrackDailyLogin` and `TrackWeeklyChallenge` after step crediting. Updated `HomeViewModel` to trigger daily login on app open. Made currency row on `HomeScreen` tappable to navigate to economy dashboard.

### Decisions
- Streak fields on PlayerProfileEntity (no separate LoginStreakEntity) — avoids extra table/DAO/repo.
- Long-distance Gem bonuses deferred to Plan 21 (milestones).
- Wave milestone: 1 PS base, 2 PS at multiples of 10, 5 PS at multiples of 25.
- TrackWeeklyChallenge/TrackDailyLogin use DAOs directly (data-layer integration, not pure domain).

### Test results
- 179 total JVM tests (170 existing + 9 new AwardWaveMilestone), all green, 0 failures.

### What remains
- TrackWeeklyChallenge and TrackDailyLogin unit tests (need DAO fakes — deferred to Plan 29).
- Long-distance walking Gem bonuses (Plan 21).
- Weekly challenge reset notification.

## Run — 2026-03-09 — Plan 21: Milestones & Daily Missions

### Objective
Implement lifetime walking milestones and daily missions with progress tracking and claim rewards.

### Design decisions
- Card Pack milestone rewards → equivalent Gems (Tutorial=50, Rare=150, Epic=500). Keeps OpenCardPack untouched.
- Cosmetic milestone rewards → stored as claimed but no-op visually until cosmetics system exists.
- Walking mission progress → DAO query approach (steps already tracked).
- Battle mission progress → accumulated in BattleViewModel.endRound().
- Workshop/Lab mission progress → updated at call sites.
- DB version 5 with destructive fallback (still in dev).

### What was done
1. **Task 1 — Domain models**: Created `MilestoneReward` (sealed class: Gems/PowerStones/Cosmetic), `Milestone` (6 entries matching GDD §16.1 with card pack→Gem equivalents), `DailyMissionType` (6 entries: 2 walking, 2 battle, 2 upgrade), `MissionCategory` enum.

2. **Task 2 — Milestone DB layer**: Created `MilestoneEntity` + `MilestoneDao`. Updated `AppDatabase` (version 5, 11 entities). Updated `DatabaseModule` with 2 new DAO providers.

3. **Task 3 — Mission DB layer**: Created `DailyMissionEntity` + `DailyMissionDao` (with `countClaimable` Flow query).

4. **Task 4 — Use cases**: Created `CheckMilestones` (queries DAO, filters by threshold + unclaimed) and `ClaimMilestone` (credits Gems/PS, marks claimed, cosmetics no-op).

5. **Task 5 — GenerateDailyMissions**: Date-seeded Random, 1 per category, idempotent (skips if missions exist for today).

6. **Task 6 — Progress hooks**: 
   - `BattleViewModel.endRound()` → updates REACH_WAVE and KILL_ENEMIES missions.
   - `WorkshopViewModel.purchase()` → updates SPEND_WORKSHOP_STEPS mission.
   - `LabsViewModel` → updates COMPLETE_RESEARCH mission after rush/completion.

7. **Task 7 — Missions screen**: Created `MissionsUiState`, `MissionsViewModel` (combines missions + milestones + profile + tick), `MissionsScreen` (daily missions with progress bars + claim buttons, milestones with progress + claim, midnight countdown).

8. **Task 8 — Home integration**: Added `Screen.Missions` route, `claimableMissionCount` to `HomeUiState`, missions badge button on `HomeScreen`, `GenerateDailyMissions` call in `HomeViewModel.init`, 5-flow `combine()` with milestone/mission counts.

### Test results
- 206 total JVM tests (179 existing + 27 new), all green, 0 failures.
- New: MilestoneTest (6), DailyMissionTypeTest (7), CheckMilestonesTest (4), ClaimMilestoneTest (4), GenerateDailyMissionsTest (6).
- New fakes: FakeMilestoneDao, FakeDailyMissionDao.

### What remains
- Milestone cosmetic rewards are no-op (needs cosmetics system — Plan 26/27).
- Walking mission auto-progress runs once on MissionsScreen open (not continuously from DailyStepManager) — sufficient since steps flow updates the ViewModel.
- Daily mission notification on completion (deferred to Plan 23).

## Run — 2026-03-09 — Plan 22: Stats & History Screen

### Objective
Build the Stats & History screen with walking history charts, battle stats, and all-time aggregates.

### Design decisions
- Canvas-drawn bar chart (no third-party library, matches existing Canvas patterns).
- Lifetime currency counters (totalGemsEarned/Spent, totalPowerStonesEarned/Spent) on PlayerProfileEntity — tracked at DAO/repository level, zero caller changes.
- Battle stats (totalRoundsPlayed, totalEnemiesKilled, totalCashEarned) on PlayerProfileEntity — no separate entity.
- DB version 6 with destructive fallback.

### What was done
1. **Task 1 — Data layer**: Added 7 new columns to `PlayerProfileEntity` (totalGemsEarned/Spent, totalPowerStonesEarned/Spent, totalRoundsPlayed, totalEnemiesKilled, totalCashEarned). Updated `PlayerProfile` domain model, `PlayerProfileDao` (6 new queries), `PlayerRepositoryImpl` (lifetime tracking in add/spend methods + incrementBattleStats), `PlayerRepository` interface, `FakePlayerRepository`. Bumped DB to version 6.

2. **Task 2 — Battle stats wiring**: Added `playerRepository.incrementBattleStats()` call in `BattleViewModel.endRound()`.

3. **Task 3 — StatsViewModel**: Created `StatsUiState` (DailyBarData, StatsPeriod enum) and `StatsViewModel` (4-flow combine: profile + history + upgrades + period). Builds bar data for 7-day/30-day/12-week views. Computes daysActive, averageDailySteps, totalWorkshopLevels.

4. **Task 4 — Walking history chart**: Created `WalkingHistoryChart` Canvas composable — vertical bars with primary/secondary color split (sensor steps vs step-equivalents), 50k ceiling dashed line, date labels, y-axis scale, FilterChip period toggle, legend.

5. **Task 5 — Stats screen**: Created `StatsScreen` with 4 Card sections (Walking History, Today's Activity, Battle Stats, All-Time Stats). Replaced placeholder in `MainActivity`.

### Test results
- 206 total JVM tests, all green, 0 failures. No new tests (presentation-only plan).

### What remains
- Lifetime currency counters start from 0 (no retroactive backfill).
- Chart tap-for-detail tooltip deferred to Plan 27 polish.
- Pull-to-refresh deferred (data is already reactive via Flows).

## Run — 2026-03-09 — Plan 23: Notifications & Widget

### Objective
Enhanced notifications, home screen widget, smart reminders, milestone alerts, and notification preferences.

### Design decisions
- Traditional AppWidgetProvider + RemoteViews (no Glance dependency).
- Smart reminders piggyback on existing StepSyncWorker (no separate WorkManager job).
- SharedPreferences for notification preferences (consistent with BiomePreferences pattern).

### What was done
1. **Task 1 — NotificationPreferences**: Created `data/NotificationPreferences.kt` — 4 boolean toggles (persistent, supply drops, smart reminders, milestone alerts).

2. **Task 2 — Enhanced persistent notification**: Updated `StepNotificationManager` with Workshop/Battle action buttons via PendingIntents. Updated `StepCounterService` to pass actual step balance from PlayerRepository. Added preference gate. Extended `MainActivity` deep-link handling for workshop/battle/missions routes.

3. **Task 3 — Home screen widget**: Created `widget_step_counter.xml` layout, `step_widget_info.xml` metadata, `StepWidgetProvider` (AppWidgetProvider with SharedPreferences-backed data), `WidgetUpdateHelper` (60s throttle). Integrated into `DailyStepManager`. Registered in AndroidManifest.

4. **Task 4 — Smart reminders**: Created `SmartReminderManager` — checks prefs enabled, not sent today, lastActiveAt > 4h, finds cheapest upgrade within 10k step gap. Uses `reminders` notification channel. Integrated into `StepSyncWorker.doWork()`.

5. **Task 5 — Milestone alerts**: Created `MilestoneNotificationManager` — notifyNewBestWave() and notifyMilestoneAchieved(). Uses `milestones` channel. Integrated into `BattleViewModel.endRound()` (new best wave) and `HomeViewModel.init` (achievable milestones).

6. **Task 6 — Supply drop preference gate**: Updated `SupplyDropNotificationManager` to inject NotificationPreferences and skip if disabled.

7. **Task 7 — Settings UI**: Created `NotificationSettingsViewModel` + `NotificationSettingsScreen` (4 Switch toggles). Added `Screen.Settings` route, wired in NavHost, added settings button on HomeScreen.

### Test results
- 206 total JVM tests, all green, 0 failures. No new tests (Android notification/widget APIs).

### What remains
- Custom notification icons (all channels use system placeholders).
- Widget balance shows 0 (DailyStepManager doesn't query PlayerRepository for balance).
- Widget preview image for widget picker.

## Run — 2026-03-09 — Plan 25: Anti-Cheat & Validation

### Objective
Harden anti-cheat beyond basic rate limiting + daily ceiling + HC escrow. Add velocity analysis, graduated cross-validation, activity minute gaming prevention, and per-minute overlap deduction.

### Design decisions
- No accelerometer sensor — step velocity analysis detects shakers via statistical patterns (zero battery cost).
- No Room entity for logging — SharedPreferences counters + Logcat (no DB migration needed).
- Cross-validation offense count in SharedPreferences (survives DB wipes, matches existing prefs pattern).
- Added mockito-kotlin 5.4.0 as test dependency for mocking Android classes in JVM tests.
- Enabled `unitTests.isReturnDefaultValues = true` in build.gradle.kts for android.util.Log in tests.

### What was done
1. **Task 1 — AntiCheatPreferences**: Created `data/anticheat/AntiCheatPreferences.kt` — SharedPreferences wrapper with daily counters (rate rejected, velocity penalized, activity minutes rejected), cross-validation offense tracking (count + last date), and 7-day offense decay.

2. **Task 2 — StepVelocityAnalyzer**: Created `data/sensor/StepVelocityAnalyzer.kt` — rolling 15-min window, two heuristics: instant jump detection (idle→spike in last 3 pairs) and constant rate detection (CV < 0.05 over 10-min window). Returns penalty multiplier (1.0/0.5/0.0).

3. **Task 3 — DailyStepManager wiring**: Added `StepVelocityAnalyzer` and `AntiCheatPreferences` as constructor dependencies. Pipeline: rate limit → velocity analysis → ceiling → persist. Logs rate-rejected and velocity-penalized steps. Added `stepsPerMinute` map for overlap deduction. Resets on day rollover.

4. **Task 4 — Enhanced StepCrossValidator**: Rewrote with graduated response based on offense count: Level 0 (escrow, 3 syncs), Level 1 (escrow, 2 syncs), Level 2 (cap at HC value), Level 3 (cap at HC minus 10%). Records offenses on discrepancy, decays on reconciliation.

5. **Task 5 — ActivityMinuteValidator**: Created `data/healthconnect/ActivityMinuteValidator.kt` — filters sessions: discards <2min micro-sessions, truncates >4hr sessions to 240min, rejects sessions beyond 5 distinct activity types per day.

6. **Task 6 — StepSyncWorker wiring**: Added `ActivityMinuteValidator` to constructor. Sessions filtered through validator before conversion. Passes `dailyStepManager.getSensorStepsPerMinute()` instead of `emptyMap()`.

7. **Task 7 — Per-minute overlap deduction**: Added `stepsPerMinute` accumulator to `DailyStepManager` (epoch-minute → credited steps). Capped at 1440 entries. Exposed via `getSensorStepsPerMinute()`. `ActivityMinuteConverter` now receives real per-minute data for double-counting prevention.

### Test results
- 222 total JVM tests (206 existing + 16 new), all green, 0 failures.
- New: StepVelocityAnalyzerTest (6), ActivityMinuteValidatorTest (5), StepCrossValidatorTest (5).
- Build: assembleDebug successful.

### What remains
- StepCrossValidator Level 2/3 could also adjust `creditedSteps` in Room (currently only escrows excess).
- AntiCheatPreferences counters not surfaced in any UI (debug screen could be added).
- Step burst trigger for supply drops still deferred.

## Run — 2026-03-09 — Plan 26: Monetization & Ads

### Objective
Implement monetization layer with stub billing/ads, cosmetic store, Season Pass, and reward ads.

### Design decisions
- Stub-first architecture: `BillingManager` and `RewardAdManager` interfaces in domain (pure Kotlin), stub impls in data. Swap via DI bindings when real SDKs integrated.
- Season Pass daily Gem bonus piggybacks on existing `TrackDailyLogin` (automatic, not manual claim).
- Cosmetic store uses placeholder items — visual application deferred to Plan 27.
- `OpenCardPack` gets `isFree: Boolean = false` default param — backward-compatible, zero caller impact.
- No new test dependencies needed — stubs are simple enough to not warrant dedicated tests.
- DB version 7 with destructive fallback (still in dev).

### What was done
1. **Task 1 — Database & Profile**: Added 5 monetization fields to `PlayerProfileEntity` (`adRemoved`, `seasonPassActive`, `seasonPassExpiry`, `freeLabRushUsedToday`, `freeCardPackAdUsedToday`). Created `CosmeticEntity` + `CosmeticDao`. Bumped DB to version 7 (12 entities). Updated `PlayerProfileDao` (4 new queries), `PlayerRepository` interface (4 new methods), `PlayerRepositoryImpl`, `FakePlayerRepository`.

2. **Task 2 — Billing Manager Stub**: Created `BillingProduct` enum (5 products), `PurchaseResult` sealed class, `BillingManager` interface, `StubBillingManager` (500ms delay, always succeeds), `BillingModule` DI binding.

3. **Task 3 — Gem Pack Purchase + Store UI**: Created `PurchaseGemPack` use case, `StoreScreen` (Gem packs, Ad Removal, Season Pass, Cosmetics sections), `StoreViewModel`, `StoreUiState`. Added `Screen.Store` route, wired in `MainActivity` NavHost.

4. **Task 4 — Ad Removal**: Ad Removal card in StoreScreen, `StoreViewModel.purchaseAdRemoval()`, "Already Purchased" state.

5. **Task 5 — Season Pass**: Updated `TrackDailyLogin` with `seasonPassActive`/`seasonPassExpiry` params (+10 Gems/day). Updated `LabsViewModel` with `freeRush()` method and `seasonPassFreeRushAvailable` state. Updated `LabsScreen` with "Free ⭐" button. Season Pass card in StoreScreen.

6. **Task 6 — Reward Ad Stub**: Created `AdPlacement` enum (3 placements), `AdResult` sealed class, `RewardAdManager` interface, `StubRewardAdManager` (1s delay, always rewards), `AdModule` DI binding.

7. **Task 7 — Post-Round Ads**: Added `adRemoved`/`gemAdWatched`/`psAdWatched` to `RoundEndState`. Injected `RewardAdManager` into `BattleViewModel`, added `watchGemAd()`/`watchPsAd()`. Updated `PostRoundOverlay` with ad buttons (hidden if adRemoved, disabled after use).

8. **Task 8 — Free Card Pack Ad**: Added `isFree` param to `OpenCardPack` (backward-compatible default). Injected `RewardAdManager` into `CardsViewModel`, added `watchFreePackAd()`. Updated `CardsScreen` with "🎬 Free Pack (Ad)" button (hidden if adRemoved, disabled if used today).

9. **Task 9 — Cosmetic Store**: Created `CosmeticCategory` enum, `CosmeticItem` domain model, `CosmeticRepository` interface, `CosmeticRepositoryImpl` (7 placeholder items, seed on first access). Added cosmetics section to StoreScreen with buy/equip/unequip.

10. **Task 10 — Integration**: Added Store button to HomeScreen and Economy screen. Season Pass badge on HomeScreen. All ad UI gated on `adRemoved` flag.

### Test results
- 222 total JVM tests, all green, 0 failures. No new tests (stub implementations, presentation-only changes).
- Build: assembleDebug successful.

### What remains (deferred)
- Google Play Billing Library v7 integration (replace StubBillingManager).
- AdMob SDK integration (replace StubRewardAdManager).
- Real purchase verification and receipt validation.
- Subscription renewal handling and grace periods.
- Real cosmetic content and visual application (Plan 27).
- Play Console product configuration and test tracks.
- Ad mediation for fill rate optimization.
- ADR for stub billing decision (documented in plan-26-monetization.md instead).

## Run: 2026-03-09 — Plan 27: Polish & Visual Effects

**Objective:** Add visual polish and audio to the battle renderer and UI.

**Decisions:**
- (a) Pooled particle system (200 pre-allocated) over lightweight ad-hoc allocation — avoids GC pressure during combat.
- (a) Minimal sound set (~7 reusable sounds) over full per-type set — sufficient for v1.0, easy to expand later.
- (a) Floating cash text on Canvas (game thread) over Compose overlay — same coordinate space, no latency.
- (a) System ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE for reduced motion — no in-app toggle needed.
- (a) Placeholder WAV files as sine wave tones — real audio assets to be sourced separately.

**Created files:**
- `presentation/battle/effects/ParticlePool.kt` — Particle class + ParticlePool (200 capacity, acquire/release/recycle)
- `presentation/battle/effects/ReducedMotionCheck.kt` — Reads system ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE
- `presentation/battle/effects/EffectEngine.kt` — Effect interface + EffectEngine (manages effects, owns pool + screen shake)
- `presentation/battle/effects/ScreenShake.kt` — Canvas translate oscillation with decay
- `presentation/battle/effects/ProjectileTrailEffect.kt` — Spawns fading trail particles at projectile positions
- `presentation/battle/effects/DeathEffect.kt` — Per-enemy-type death burst (6 types, 6-20 particles each)
- `presentation/battle/effects/FloatingText.kt` — "+X" cash text that drifts up and fades
- `presentation/battle/effects/UWVisualEffect.kt` — 6 particle-based UW spectacles (replaces old geometric rendering)
- `presentation/battle/effects/OverdriveAuraEffect.kt` — 4 overdrive aura particle emitters
- `presentation/battle/effects/WaveAnnouncement.kt` — Wave number + boss warning text overlay + cooldown countdown
- `presentation/audio/SoundManager.kt` — SoundPool wrapper, 7 sound effects, volume/mute, shoot throttling
- `data/SoundPreferences.kt` — SharedPreferences for sound mute/volume
- `res/raw/sfx_*.ogg` — 7 placeholder WAV audio files (sine wave tones)

**Created tests:**
- `presentation/battle/effects/ParticlePoolTest.kt` — 9 tests (acquire, release, recycle, expire, clear, reset)
- `presentation/battle/effects/ScreenShakeTest.kt` — 6 tests (trigger, decay, override, reset, offset)
- `presentation/battle/effects/DeathEffectTest.kt` — 7 tests (particle count per enemy type)

**Modified files:**
- `presentation/battle/engine/GameEngine.kt` — Full rewrite: integrated EffectEngine, removed old UW rendering (uwEffects list, uwPaint, inline render code), added all trigger points (trail, death, floating text, UW spectacle, overdrive aura, wave announcement, screen shake, sound), added reducedMotion parameter to init()
- `presentation/battle/engine/WaveSpawner.kt` — Made phaseTimer publicly readable (for cooldown text)
- `presentation/battle/entities/ZigguratEntity.kt` — Removed old aura circle rendering (auraPulse, auraPaint), added centerY property, kept overdrive timer bar
- `presentation/battle/GameSurfaceView.kt` — Added SoundManager init, reduced motion check, passes isReducedMotion to engine.init()
- `presentation/battle/BattleViewModel.kt` — Added upgrade purchase sound trigger
- `presentation/settings/NotificationSettingsViewModel.kt` — Added SoundPreferences injection, soundMuted state
- `presentation/settings/NotificationSettingsScreen.kt` — Added Sound section with mute toggle
- `presentation/workshop/UpgradeCard.kt` — Added purchase pulse animation (1.05x scale, 100ms, reduced motion aware)
- `presentation/home/HomeScreen.kt` — Added animateContentSize() to step counter
- `presentation/MainActivity.kt` — Added screen transition animations (fadeIn + slideInHorizontally, reduced motion aware)

**Test results:** 244 JVM tests — all green (was 222, +22 new).
**Build:** assembleDebug successful, 2 minor warnings (redundant conversion, hiltViewModel deprecation).

**What remains:**
- Plan 28: Balancing & Tuning (next on critical path)
- Replace placeholder audio with real royalty-free sound effects
- Plan 29: Testing & QA
- Plan 30: Release Prep
